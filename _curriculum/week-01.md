title: Introduction to Experience Design and AI 
week: 1
date: 2025-01-21

This introductory class will go over the course syllabus, course expectations, and introduce to students key concepts in designing AI systems. We will cover case studies of AI in learning systems, such as, the use of social agents to scaffold learning, and chatbots for scaffolding problem-solving. We will discuss students’ early understandings of applications and implications of using AI systems in learning environments. Through seminal works, students will get introduced to basic concepts in AI for learning, such as, personalization, social interaction, adaptive systems, emotion recognition, contextual feedback, and data analytics. 


## In-class Activity
Speculate AI Futures: Consider your current learning environment. How do you gain new knowledge? How do you pick new skills? How do you interact with your peers and technology while learning? Now imagine a futuristic learning environment. Consider using emerging technologies to design an ideal learning environment. Create a scenario, in the form of a short story, of a learner living in this speculative world. 

Now you take the role of a given stakeholder in this future world. What would your role as this stakeholder be, in this future learning environment?
