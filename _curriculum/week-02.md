title: Designing Human-centered AI - I 
week: 2
date: 2025-01-28

We often hear of the human and AI dichotomy, but can they flourish in tandem? Students are introduced to key concepts in human-centered AI (HCAI), and we go over the two-dimensional HCAI framework (Shneiderman, 2022). We discuss the HCAI concepts: user-centered design, transparency, explainability, inclusivity, equity, safety, and regulation. We especially dive deeper into Explainable AI (XAI), and explainability implications for AI systems in learning.

## Assignment 1
Code activity (Jupyter Notebook) - Introduction to using AI APIs. Through a guided code notebook, students will be able to use AI APIs to design a learning chatbot (e.g. a history bot that guesses a historical figure or event). This activity will also get students up to speed with Python programming.
