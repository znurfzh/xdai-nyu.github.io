Students will present their 2-minute project pitches (individually) that you submitted in week 3. You can modify your slides if needed. Use individual pitches to form project teams. We will then continue the AI overview lecture from week 2. 

## Week 4 Readings

Write or draw a brief scenario explaining how you imagine AI will transform teaching and learning. Scenarios may be inspired from the readings, or your own speculations.

## Project Pitches 
Revise your project pitches for next week's class. This is to gauge early interests. We will use these project pitchs to form groups for your final projects. Make sure your slides are in the group drive.
