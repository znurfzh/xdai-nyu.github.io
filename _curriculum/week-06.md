title: AI in Learning 
week: 6
date: 2025-02-25
---

In a flipped classroom style, we discuss historic case studies of instructional technology, and students’ lived experiences of their long-term impact. What changed with calculators in the classroom? With computers? With AI? We will discuss scaffolding using AI chatbots, and early findings from research pieces discussing personalized scaffolding. Students will explore key concepts in personalized ML algorithms, AI for assistive learning, adaptive systems, AI tutors, social AI companions, educational data mining and learning analytics. We will dive deeper into AI for fostering learning behaviors, such as, curiosity, growth mindset and creativity. 

## In-class Activity
 Students will interact with a co-writing tool scaffolding different writing styles and vocabulary development in storytelling. Students will reflect on ownership in a co-created human-AI artifact. 

## Week 5 Readings

1. Self-study: Technology has transformed educational spaces and pedagogies in the past. Choose a technology (i.e., radio, television, computers, or the internet) and research (use any sources: internet, magazines, movies, etc.) its reported impact on classrooms and teacher pedagogy.

## Project Update 1
Meet with your teams to decide on your problem statement. Teams will write the first draft of their problem statement, including:
1. Outline their target learning audience
2. An identified learning need (with references, or personal experiences) 
3. A rationale for how you imagine AI may assist this learning need
4. Footnote: Contribution of each group member (this footnote need to be a short line after each group submission)

<!-- ## Project Update 3
Students will conduct a literature review in the use of technology addressing the learning needs they identified. They will write two accounts of projects or papers addressing (or failing to address) those learning needs.
