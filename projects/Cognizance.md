## Target Learning Audience:
The target audience for this project is adult learners (college students, graduates, working professionals) who engage with reading assignments in humanities, social sciences, and STEM courses. These students often encounter dense, complex academic texts that require critical thinking, interpretation, and synthesis of ideas. Many struggle to extract key insights, connect concepts across readings, and engage deeply with course materials. Additionally, challenges arise in large courses where individualized guidance is difficult.

## Project Brief (Updated):  
Reading assignments are a fundamental part of college education, yet many students find them overwhelming and struggle with comprehension. Research suggests that academic texts often use discipline-specific language, complex structures, and abstract arguments that can hinder understanding, particularly for students new to the subject (Snow, 2002). Many students engage with readings passively, skimming the text without developing a deep understanding or making connections to broader course themes (Chi, 2009). Instructors often encourage students to take an active approach to reading—annotating, questioning, summarizing, and synthesizing—but providing individualized scaffolding for these strategies is difficult in large classroom settings.

Scaffolding effectively supports students' reading comprehension, particularly when students are guided through progressive levels of engagement with the text (Wood, Bruner, & Ross, 1976). However, traditional methods of scaffolding, such as instructor-led discussions and guided reading exercises, are difficult to scale. Many students are left to navigate complex texts on their own, often struggling to engage with the material at the deeper level expected in college courses.

## Rationale for AI Assistant
AI can provide a personalized scaffolding experience that helps college students engage in active, deeper reading of course materials. The AI assistant can work alongside students as they complete reading assignments, offering structured guidance to help them process, analyze, and critically engage with texts. Prior research shows that AI-enhanced reading interventions can improve comprehension, promote metacognition, and foster deeper engagement with academic texts (Graesser et al., 2005; McNamara et al., 2012).

The AI will provide scaffolded reading support through:
1. Scaffolding Learning – AI guides students through structured questioning, interactive explanations, and learning progress visualization.
2. Encouraging Constructive Negotiation – AI challenges students with counterarguments, debate prompts, and opposing viewpoints.

We translated those into several features:
**Must Have**: 
1. ✅ Personalized Questioning: Provide a scaffolding based on students’ personal ZPD and needs using the Socratic method and structured breakdown.
2. ✅ Context-Aware Responses: AI grounds responses in course materials (RAG approach).
Provides citations & links to relevant resources to reduce misinformation.
3. ✅ Go Deeper/Simplify Option: As part of scaffolding, suggest students prompts/topics to ask the AI.

**Nice to Have**
1. Notes: A dedicated section for note-taking, to sum up the main points of conversations with AI.
2. Analytics: Tracking data analytics to improve students' learning performance.
3. Summary: Informational menu to summarize the conversation, key terms, and additional resources to delve deeper into the concept.
